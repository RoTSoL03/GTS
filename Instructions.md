## 🔍 Purpose of This Repository

This GitHub repository is established to:

- Serve as the **central platform** for developing our research system.
- Act as a **version control** mechanism to manage code changes.
- **Track individual contributions** throughout the project timeline.
- Enable the research leader to monitor **daily activity and progress** efficiently.

## 🌿 Branch Structure Overview

Each member will be assigned a **dedicated personal branch**. These branches will act as individual “working logs” where you are expected to push your changes regularly.


---

## ✅ Daily Commit Protocol

To maintain a smooth and trackable workflow, please follow these steps:

1. **Work strictly within your own branch.**
2. **Commit regularly** as you make progress (preferably once per work session).
3. Use **clear and descriptive commit messages**.
4. **Push your changes daily**, even if they are minor.
5. I will **review branches daily** to check development status and provide feedback.

---

## 📎 Notes

- Do **not** commit directly to the `main` branch unless explicitly instructed.
- If you need help with Git commands or branch management, feel free to ask.
- Stay consistent to help the team maintain momentum and visibility.

Let’s keep the collaboration productive and transparent. Thank you for your commitment!
